# Status Page Web UI

This is the web UI for the SCS statuspage.

Right now, it only contains the HTML prototype used to develop the design, layout and necessary features. It will soon be joined by an actual Angular implementation.

Please note that even the HTML prototype is still considered WIP and not necessarily the final design or complete.
